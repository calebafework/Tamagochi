## Tamagotchi
For this project I decided to make a virtual pet. The goal of the game is to keep the virtual pet alive until the timer runs out. You will need to feed, provide medicine, and provide affection to the pet when needed or you will lose the game.

### Motivation
I grew up with a sister who had a Tamagotchi collection, so seeing this idea brought back memories of how annoying I thought the game was. My goal was to try and make the game more annoying

### Code snippets 
I had a really hard time trying to make the image sit centered on the page so I decided to make the animated pet one solid .gif

    ```javascript:
    //TO SWITCH BACKGROUND GIF
    let switchImg = document.getElementById('parent-image')
    switchImg.src='tamagotchi-sad.gif'
    ```

### Future improvements 
Fix all bugs and re-writing to make it more efficient. I also **really** wanted to add more animation and sounds. I would also like to make different characters to choose from.
